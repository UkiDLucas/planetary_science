physiological life:
- eating
- metabolizing
- excreting
- breathing
- growing
- moving
- responsive to external stimuli
exceptions: viruses, prions, cities, vehicles, etc.

metabolic:
- consumes energy
- exchanges materials with environment without changing form
exception: fire

biochemical:
- contains reproducible hereditary information
exceptions: viruses, prions (misfolded protein),

thermodynamic:
- second law of thermodynamics (enthopy always increases)
- self-contained system that takes energy to create order locally

Genetic (Darwinian)
- capable of undergoing evolution

example fire

building blocks of life:
- lipids (hydrophilic, hydrophobic membranes) storage of energy
- 20 amino acids 
    (proteins, enzymes, amino groupNH2, carboxyl group COOH, R group)
    provide structure, catalyze reactions, transport molecules,
- nucleic acids (DNA, RNA) Nucleotides
    C-N-H2, C=N-C-C
- carbohydrates (sugars) 
    C6H12O6 (glucose) energy storage and transport 
    H-C-OH, C=O

Common elements:
- hydrogen
- helium
- carbon
- oxygen
- neon
- magnesium
- silicon
- calcium
- sulfur
- iron
- nitrogen 
- phosphorus
Rare elements:

- gold
- platinum
- zirconium
- lithium
- berillium
- boron
