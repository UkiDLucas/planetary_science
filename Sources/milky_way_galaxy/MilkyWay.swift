/**
The Milky Way galaxy
 is estimated to have a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs, 
 or 87,400 light-years. The Milky Way
 is a barred spiral galaxy 
 that is about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms, 
 but thicker at the bulge

 The Milky Way's disk is about 40,000 parsecs across, 
 and the Sun is about 8,000 parsecs from the center. 
 However, researchers disagree on the exact value of the distance 
 from the Sun to the Galactic Center
. 
The Milky Way is about 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 kilometers across, 
which is about 100,000 light years.
